* Binary search is a powerful search algorithm that works efficiently on sorted arrays. Here's how it works:

* Divide and Conquer: It starts by considering the entire array and then repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
* Comparison with the Middle Element: It compares the target value with the middle element of the current subarray.
* If the target is equal to the middle element, the search is successful.
* If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the subarray.
* If the target is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the right half of the subarray.
* Repeat until Found: This process of dividing the search interval and comparing with the middle element is repeated until the target is found or the search space becomes empty.
